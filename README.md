# Find-difference-between-sums-of-two-diagonals

### Given a matrix of n X n. The task is to calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonal.

### Example :
Input :           3
                   11 2 4
                   4 5 6
                  10 8 -12 
                  
Output : 15
Sum of primary diagonal = 11 + 5 + (-12) = 4.
Sum of secondary diagonal = 4 + 5 + 10 = 19.
Difference = |4-19| = 15.
